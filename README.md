# Random Wikipedia Generator

 With this extension you can open a random wikipedia page, while excluding/including certain categories. 
 
 For example, if I don't want to read pages regarding bilateral relations - I can write "Bilateral relations" in the list of unwanted descriptions, and the extension will generate a random page without such a description. Alternatively, if someone wants to read only on bilateral relations he can write this in the descriptions list, and uncheck the 'exclude' button, such that he gets only the pages with that description.
